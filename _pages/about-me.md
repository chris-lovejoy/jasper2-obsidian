Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris Lovejoy.

## Medicine

I studied Medicine at Cambridge University from 2011 to 2017, and have worked as a doctor at several hospitals around London since then.

-   **Book:** I wrote a short book sharing experiences, reflections and advice for learning medicine. You can read it [here](https://chrislovejoy.me/book/) or buy it [on](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Medical-Student-Manual-fulfilling/dp/1973413590/) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Medical-Student-Manual-fulfilling/dp/1973413590/).
-   **Blog:** [Here](https://chrislovejoy.me/tag/medicine/) I share reflections on learning medicine, articles I have published and thoughts on the future of healthcare.

## Machine Learning

After qualifying as a doctor, I studied machine learning - initially self-taught then a Master's Degree - before working full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer.

-   **Blog**: [Here](https://chrislovejoy.me/tag/machine-learning/) are posts for people interested in machine learning applied to medicine, including research paper summaries, resource recommendations, a careers guide and answer to questions I often get asked.
-   **Courses:** I run in-person machine learning for healthcare courses in London, both independently and [for UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics/machine-learning-healthcare). I've recorded these as a video series available [here](https://chrislovejoy.me/ml-health/).
-   **Academic:** For those interested in my academic work, my publications are available [here](https://chrislovejoy.me/publications/).
